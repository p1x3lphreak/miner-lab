# **Miner-Lab**

A modular, self-installing mining automation suite for Debian-based systems.  
Provides automatic monitoring, reporting, and maintenance for XMRig-based rigs.

---

## **ðŸ“¦ Components**
| Service | Function |
|----------|-----------|
| miner-syncd | Core environment and Pushcut sync daemon |
| xmrig-summary | Daily Pushcut summary of rig performance |
| xmrig-watchdog | Continuous health monitor and auto-restart |
| xmrig-autotune | Optional performance optimizer |

---

## **ðŸ§± Installers**
Each service can be installed individually:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p1x3lphreak/miner-lab/main/install-scripts/install-miner-syncd.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p1x3lphreak/miner-lab/main/install-scripts/install-xmrig-summary.sh | bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p1x3lphreak/miner-lab/main/install-scripts/install-xmrig-watchdog.sh | bash
```

Compiled installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p1x3lphreak/miner-lab/main/install-scripts/install-miner-lab.sh | bash
```
see advanced options in next section for additional install options

---

### **ðŸ§  Advanced Options**Â 
When running the installer manually (instead of via curl), you can enable additional flags to customize behavior:

|**Flag**|**Description**|**Example**| 
| --- | --- | --- |
|--force|Forces a full environment reconfiguration. Deletes the existing /etc/miner-lab.env file and re-prompts for rig name and Pushcut URLs.|bash install-miner-lab.sh --force|
|--with-autotune|Runs the xmrig-autotune.sh module immediately after setup to benchmark and optimize CPU thread performance for your miner.|bash install-miner-lab.sh --with-autotune|
|--force --with-autotune|Rebuilds the environment _and_ runs a fresh autotune pass (recommended for new or upgraded rigs).|bash install-miner-lab.sh --force --with-autotune|
Autotune results are stored within the Miner-Lab working directory and are automatically applied by future XMRig sessions.

---

### **ðŸ§© Example: Full Reinstall with Autotune**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p1x3lphreak/miner-lab/main/install-scripts/install-miner-lab.sh | bash -s -- --force --with-autotune
```
This command:
1. Removes any prior environment configuration.
2. Pulls all sub-installers and services from GitHub.
3. Deploys systemd units and logrotate.
4. Performs a one-time autotune benchmark for your CPU threads.
